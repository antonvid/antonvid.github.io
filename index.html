        <p>I am a final-year Computer Science undergraduate at Goldsmiths, University of London. I have a fundamental knowledge of both back-end and front-end development. I work part-time as a bartender.</p>

            <h3>Game Project — JavaScript, December 2022</h3>
            <p>
                This was the first project I completed at uni in which I was tasked with developing a simple game using the p5.js JavaScript library. This allowed me to gain fundamental skills in computer science, including variable types, conditional statements, loops, and arrays.

                This was my introduction to mainstream, front-end development. Using barebones HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I developed a responsive website with a unique design that was visually interesting and functional. With this, I learned the importance of user design and creating something that can work effectively across different devices.

            <p>
                For this project, I worked as part of a team of two.  We collaborated with partners to create a web-based drawing app. Drawing on the skills I developed while working on the game project (discussed below), we used the p5.js library to track mouse movement and render the canvas. We implemented several tools, shapes and brushes. The most challenging feature we implemented was an undo button. We solved this using the get() and image() functions of p5.js to create save states that we could switch between. This was my first time developing as part of a group. The experience helped me to refine numerous skills, including workflow, code bases, and Git.

            <h3>World Cup Simulator — Java, January 2024</h3>
            <p>
                For this project, I processed team data from two CSV files in Java, one for player data and the other for manager data. I took this and created squads of eleven out of each team's best players. I  then simulated a World Cup tournament, whereby teams went through group stages.  For each match, the team with the best average player and manager stats won. This project utilised classes and subclasses to handle creating player, manager and team objects.

            <p>
                Along with four other students, I  developed a responsive web application that tracked users' ingredients and provided relevant recipes. Our aim was to reduce food waste by providing users with an effective meal plan that would use most, if not all, of their ingredients before they went bad. This was built from the ground up using Flask and MySQL for the back-end and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end. We used the Spoonacular API to access a large selection of recipes. This continued my growth as a team player and introduced me to utilising APIs and back-end web development using Flask.
